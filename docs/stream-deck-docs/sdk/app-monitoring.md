# App Monitoring
The Stream Deck SDK can notify your plugin when an application starts (launches) or stops (terminates), allowing it to monitor pre-registered apps. This can be particularly useful if your plugin relies or interacts with a local application, for example via IPC.
## Registering Apps
To monitor an application, the name of the application must be registered in the manifest JSON file using the `ApplicationsToMonitor` property.
Example of "ApplicationsToMonitor" within the manifest JSON file

```

Finding the name / identifier of the of application depends on the operating system.
  * Windows
  * macOS

For Windows apps, Stream Deck uses the app's executable name. This information is available in the details tab of Windows Task manager. You can also navigate to the file directly in Windows explorer, or right-click on the apps shortcut and select properties to find the target `exe` file.
![StreamDeck.exe](https://docs.elgato.com/img/streamdeck/sdk/windows-task-manager.png)
On macOS, Stream Deck uses the `CFBundleIdentifier` found in the apps `Info.plist` file. It is also possible to find this using osascript in your terminal.
Terminal

```
osascript -e 'id of app "Application Name"'
```

## Apps Launching
To listen for a registered application launching, your plugin can subscribe to the `onApplicationDidLaunch` event.
Application launch event callback

```
import streamDeck, { ApplicationDidLaunchEvent } from "@elgato/streamdeck";

streamDeck.system.onApplicationDidLaunch((ev: ApplicationDidLaunchEvent) => {
	// Handle a registered application launching
	streamDeck.logger.info(ev.application); // e.g. "Elgato Wave Link.exe"
});
```

## Apps Terminating
To listen for a registered application terminating, your plugin can subscribe to the `onApplicationDidTerminate` event.
Application terminate event callback

```
import streamDeck, { ApplicationDidTerminateEvent } from "@elgato/streamdeck";

streamDeck.system.onApplicationDidTerminate((ev: ApplicationDidTerminateEvent) => {
	// Handle a registered application terminating.
	streamDeck.logger.info(ev.application); // e.g. "Elgato Wave Link.exe"
});
```
