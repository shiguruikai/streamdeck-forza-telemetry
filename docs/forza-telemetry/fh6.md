# Forza Horizon 6 "Data Out" Documentation

https://support.forza.net/hc/en-us/articles/51744149102611-Forza-Horizon-6-Data-Out-Documentation

```
Forza Horizon 6 carries forward the technology from previous Forza titles that powers motion sleds, companion apps, and more. We call it "Data Out," and players can configure it in-game to fit their needs. This page covers details of how to use and configure the feature.

Overview
After being configured in-game, telemetry output sends data packets for use by external apps. This one-way UDP traffic is sent to a remote IP address at a rate equal to the game's frame rate. This functionality is also available to the localhost address (127.0.0.1).

A single packet format is sent to the configured address, containing vehicle dynamics, tire data, race status, and player inputs.

Configuration
The following settings can be configured in-game and are found under SETTINGS > HUD AND GAMEPLAY:

Data Out: Toggles the data output function on and off. When set to On, data will begin to send as soon as the player starts driving.

Data Out IP Address: The target IP address of the remote machine receiving data. The localhost address (127.0.0.1) is supported.

Data Out IP Port: The target IP port of the remote machine receiving data. Be sure your app is listening on the same port and that firewall rules allow data on these ports to be received by your app. Avoid ports 5200 through 5300, as the game binds its own outgoing socket to a port in this range.

Output Structure
Type Notes
[Letter][Number]

The letter defines the type from one of the following:

S -- Signed Integer

U -- Unsigned Integer

F -- Floating Point

The number defines the amount of bits used.

Examples:

S8 is a signed byte with potential values between -128 and 127.
F32 is a 32-bit floating point number, equivalent to float/single.
U32 is a 32-bit unsigned integer.
Packet Format
Total packet size: 324 bytes.

Notes
Data is only sent while the player is actively driving. It is not sent during menus, pauses, replays, rewinds, or after finishing a race.
Data is transmitted out only (one-way UDP). No data is received by the game.
The packet format is fixed. Unlike Forza Motorsport, there is no option to select between different formats.
Developers of companion apps should note that Forza Horizon 6 includes three fields not present in Forza Motorsport: CarGroup, SmashableVelDiff, and SmashableMass. These are inserted after NumCylinders and before PositionX.
Forza Horizon 6 does not include TireWear or TrackOrdinal fields that are present in Forza Motorsport's "Dash" format.
