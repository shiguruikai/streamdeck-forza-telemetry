# Forza Motorsport "Data Out" Documentation

https://support.forza.net/hc/en-us/articles/21742934024211-Forza-Motorsport-Data-Out-Documentation

Forza Motorsport (2023) carries forward the technology from Forza Motorsport 7 that powers motion sleds, companion apps, and more. We call it “Data Out,” and players can configure it in-game to fit their needs. This page covers details of how to use and configure the feature.

## Overview

After being configured in-game, telemetry output sends data packets for use by external apps. This one-way UDP traffic is sent to a remote IP address at a rate of 60 packets per second. New to Forza Motorsport (2023), this functionality is now also available to the localhost address (127.0.01).

There are currently two packet formats that can be sent to the remote address, and they are identical to Forza Motorsport 7. The original data structure, “Sled,” was designed specifically for motion sleds. The second structure, “Dash,” contains all the Sled data as well as some extra data points.

## Configuration

The following settings can be configured in-game and are found under SETTINGS > GAMEPLAY & HUD > “UDP RACE TELEMETRY” header:

- Data Out: Toggles the data output function on and off. When set to On, data will begin to send as soon as the player gets onto a track.
- Data Out IP Address: The target IP address of the remote machine receiving data. The localhost address (127.0.0.1) is supported.
- Data Out IP Port: The target IP port of the remote machine receiving data. Be sure your app is listening on the same port and that firewall rules allow data on these ports to be received by your app.
- Data Out Packet Format: The format of the data to send, either “Sled” or “Dash.” See below for an outline of each format.

## Output Structures

### Type notes:

[Letter][Number]

The letter defines the type from one of the following:

S Signed Integer

U Unsigned Integer

F Floating Point

The number defines the amount of bits used.

Examples:

- S8 is a signed byte with potential values between -128 and 127.
- F32 is a 32-bit floating point number, equivalent to float/single
