# Devices
The Stream Deck SDK provides a list of available Stream Deck devices.
Array of available devices

```
import streamDeck from "@elgato/streamdeck";

streamDeck.devices.forEach((device) => {
	const { id, isConnected, name, size, type } = device;

	streamDeck.logger.info(name); // Stream Deck Neo, Stream Deck +
});
```

## Device Types
Within the Stream Deck SDK, devices are referenced against an enumeration of known devices; these devices, and their associated values, are as follows:

## Connecting
Your plugin can monitor when a Stream Deck device is connected using the `onDeviceDidConnect` event.
Device connected callback

```
import streamDeck, { DeviceDidConnectEvent } from "@elgato/streamdeck";

streamDeck.devices.onDeviceDidConnect((ev: DeviceDidConnectEvent) => {
	const { id, isConnected, name, size, type } = ev.device;

	streamDeck.logger.info(name);
});
```

## Changing
Your plugin can monitor when a Stream Deck device changes, for example its name or size, using the `onDeviceDidChange` event.
Device change callback

```
import streamDeck, { type DeviceDidChangeEvent } from "@elgato/streamdeck";

streamDeck.devices.onDeviceDidChange((ev: DeviceDidChangeEvent) => {
	const { id, isConnected, name, size, type } = ev.device;

	streamDeck.logger.info(name);
});
```

Availability
Monitoring device changes is available from Stream Deck 7.0
## Disconnecting
Your plugin can monitor when a Stream Deck device disconnects using the `onDeviceDidDisconnect` event.
Device disconnected callback

```
import streamDeck, { DeviceDidDisconnectEvent } from "@elgato/streamdeck";

streamDeck.devices.onDeviceDidDisconnect((ev: DeviceDidDisconnectEvent) => {
	const { id, isConnected, name, size, type } = ev.device;

	streamDeck.logger.info(name);
});
```

Disconnected Device Visibility
While you can use these events to optimize resource utilization, the keys/encoders can still be visible in the Stream Deck app while the hardware is disconnected.
