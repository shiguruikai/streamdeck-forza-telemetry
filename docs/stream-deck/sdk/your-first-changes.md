# Your First Changes
In this article you'll make changes to your newly generated Stream Deck plugin, and apply those changes in Stream Deck.
## Changing "Counter"
The logic that controls the "Counter" action, in the newly generated Stream Deck plugin, is located within the `IncrementCounter` class, which will look like this:
src/actions/increment-counter.ts

```
import { action, KeyDownEvent, SingletonAction, WillAppearEvent } from "@elgato/streamdeck";

@action({ UUID: "com.elgato.hello-world.increment" })
export class IncrementCounter extends SingletonAction<CounterSettings> {
	/**
	 * Occurs when the action will appear.
	 */
	override onWillAppear(ev: WillAppearEvent<CounterSettings>): void | Promise<void> {
		return ev.action.setTitle(`${ev.payload.settings.count ?? 0}`);
	}

	/**
	 * Occurs when the action's key is pressed down.
	 */
	override async onKeyDown(ev: KeyDownEvent<CounterSettings>): Promise<void> {
		// Determine the current count from the settings.
		let count = ev.payload.settings.count ?? 0;
		count++;

		// Update the current count in the action's settings, and change the title.
		await ev.action.setSettings({ count });
		await ev.action.setTitle(`${count}`);
	}
}

type CounterSettings = {
	count: number;
};
```

The `IncrementCounter` class implements two virtual methods, these are:
  * `onWillAppear`
    * Occurs when the action appears on the canvas of Stream Deck.
    * In this example, displays the current count.
  * `onKeyDown`
    * Occurs when the user presses the key down on Stream Deck
    * In this example, increments the count and shows the new count.

tip
Actions extend the `SingletonAction` class which provides virtual methods for intercepting events, for example:
  * `onWillDisappear`
  * `onKeyDown`
  * `onDialRotate`

Scenario: Change request
"The counter action currently increments the count by 1 and then displays the new count. Instead, we want the counter to be a binary counter, which doubles the count each time the key is pressed."
Within the `IncrementCounter` class, the `onKeyDown` method can be updated so that the count is doubled on each press; the method could be updated to look something like this:
Key down event changes

```
import { action, KeyDownEvent, SingletonAction, WillAppearEvent } from "@elgato/streamdeck";

@action({ UUID: "com.elgato.hello-world.increment" })
export class IncrementCounter extends SingletonAction<CounterSettings> {
	/**
	 * Occurs when the action will appear.
	 */
	override onWillAppear(ev: WillAppearEvent<CounterSettings>): void | Promise<void> {
		return ev.action.setTitle(`${ev.payload.settings.count ?? 0}`);
	}

	/**
	 * Occurs when the action's key is pressed down.
	 */
	override async onKeyDown(ev: KeyDownEvent<CounterSettings>): Promise<void> {
		// Determine the current count from the settings, and times it by two.
		let count = ev.payload.settings.count ?? 0;
		if (count === 0) {
			count = 1;
		} else {
			count = count * 2;
		}

		// Update the current count in the action's settings, and change the title.
		await ev.action.setSettings({ count });
		await ev.action.setTitle(`${count}`);
	}
}

type CounterSettings = {
	count: number;
};
```

With these changes saved, build the plugin with the following command in a terminal:
  * npm
  * yarn
  * pnpm

Terminal

```
npm run build
```

Terminal

```
yarn build
```

Terminal

```
pnpm build
```

And then restart the plugin in Stream Deck with the following command in a terminal:

```
streamdeck restart <plugin_uuid>
```

For example:
Terminal

```
streamdeck restart com.elgato.hello-world
```

Plugin UUID
Your plugin's unique identifier is a reverse-DNS string generated during the `streamdeck create` command that represents your organization and product, for example `com.elgato.wavelink`.
Pressing the Stream Deck key now should double the count, like so:

## Hot-reload
In the previous chapter, the changes to the `IncrementCounter` were applied using two commands:
  1. The `build` script.
  2. `streamdeck restart <plugin_uuid>`

An alternative approach to applying changes in real-time is hot-reloading, or live-reloading. Plugins generated from `streamdeck create` come with hot-reload as standard; to begin watching for changes to files, run the following command in a terminal:
  * npm
  * yarn
  * pnpm

Terminal

```
npm run watch
```

Terminal

```
yarn watch
```

Terminal

```
pnpm watch
```

Scenario: Change request
"The new a binary counter changes look great, but we've had a new request to reset the count to zero after it reaches 256."
With hot-reload running, let's apply changes for the new change request.
More key down even changes

```
import { action, KeyDownEvent, SingletonAction, WillAppearEvent } from "@elgato/streamdeck";

@action({ UUID: "com.elgato.hello-world.increment" })
export class IncrementCounter extends SingletonAction<CounterSettings> {
	/**
	 * Occurs when the action will appear.
	 */
	override onWillAppear(ev: WillAppearEvent<CounterSettings>): void | Promise<void> {
		return ev.action.setTitle(`${ev.payload.settings.count ?? 0}`);
	}

	/**
	 * Occurs when the action's key is pressed down.
	 */
	override async onKeyDown(ev: KeyDownEvent<CounterSettings>): Promise<void> {
		// Determine the current count from the settings.
		let count = ev.payload.settings.count ?? 0;
		if (count === 0) {
			count = 1;
		} else if (count < 256) {
			count = count * 2;
		} else {
			count = 0;
		}

		// Update the current count in the action's settings, and change the title.
		await ev.action.setSettings({ count });
		await ev.action.setTitle(`${count}`);
	}
}

type CounterSettings = {
	count: number;
};
```

Upon saving the file, the change will trigger a re-build of the plugin, and will automatically restart the plugin in Stream Deck. The changes can then be tested:

## Debugging
Stream Deck plugins leverage Node.js' built-in inspector flag for debugging, allowing you to use popular external debugging tools, such as VS Code, to step-through your plugin's execution paths whilst testing.
Attaching to your Stream Deck plugin in VS Code can be achieved with the following steps:
  1. In VS Code, open the "Quick Open" panel (`Ctrl+P` / `Cmd+P`)
  2. Enter `> Debug: Attach to Node Process`, and press `Return`.
  3. Select the `node20` process.

![VS Code attach to node process window, listing the node20 process](https://docs.elgato.com/img/streamdeck/sdk/attach-to-node-process.png)
tip
By default, Stream Deck will automatically assign an available port to the [Node.js inspect flag](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v20.x/api/cli.html#--inspecthostport) to avoid conflicts. This behavior can be overridden in the manifest's `Nodejs.Debug` property.
